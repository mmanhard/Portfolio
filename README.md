# About My Portfolio

This portfolio was built with the sole intention of showing my skills in the
field of software engineering.

It's built with GatsbyJS, which renders the React code to static HTML and CSS at
build time. Once a user visits the site, a pre-packaged Javascript bundle is
loaded asynchonously. Images are lazy loaded and queried using GraphQL.

You can check out the site live at [mmanhard.com](https://mmanhard.com).
